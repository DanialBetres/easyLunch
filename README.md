# easyLunch

At my previous job, every friday 17 Co-op students would go out for lunch. With the goal of minimizing the amount of cars taken, it took time to organize who would be driving and who would be going with each driver.

This application aims to simplify this process by allowing co-workers to sign up for lunch and specifiy whether they are driving or not.

easyLunch will create a list of drivers and the respective passengers, ensuring the drivers who can carry more passengers are priortized.
