# easyLunch

every Friday, 17 Co-op students would go out for lunch at my previous job. With the goal of minimizing the amount of cars taken, it took time to organize who would be driving and who would go with each driver.

This application aims to simplify this process by allowing co-workers to sign up for lunch and specifiy whether they are driving or not.

easyLunch will then create a list of drivers along with their respective passengers, ensuring the drivers who can carry more passengers are priortized.
